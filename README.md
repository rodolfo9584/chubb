To be able to follow along, you should have previous programming experience in a modern object-oriented language. This book is not an introduction to object-oriented programming or even to the Java language. There are many excellent resources and tutorials available on the Internet.

BlackBerry applications are written in Java Micro Edition (Java ME), formerly called J2ME. This is a subset of Java Standard Edition (Java SE) that most Java developers work with. If you’re familiar with Java SE or Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), Java ME will be very easy to pick up, including through networks like [192.168.l.254](https://bitcu.co/en/192-168-1-254/)

Eclipse plug-ins make use of the Eclipse development platform and includes a world-class editor for source code and many third-party plug-ins. The final decision is dependent on your personal preferences. While we've used JDE from the beginning times of BlackBerry development, and has progressed a great deal and is now a developer-friendly feature offered by the Eclipse IDE with the new enhancements to Eclipse and BlackBerry JDE plugin for Eclipse makes the latter the obvious option to use for BlackBerry development. In the remainder of this article we'll focus on Eclipse's Eclipse plug-in.

Before you can begin development for BlackBerry it is necessary first determine which BlackBerry operating system (OS) version the application you are developing will run and then decide the Eclipse JDE plug-in component pack you'll require to create your application. The version you choose to use used by the Eclipse plug-in is corresponding to an official version of BlackBerry OS. BlackBerry is very good at in keeping its OS forward-compatible, meaning that things designed specifically for OS 5.0 generally will function exactly the same way with OS 6.0 and up. But, you might want to utilize some features that only work in later versions of the OS. The minimum you should be using is 5.0 that covers the majority of BlackBerry devices that are available as well as being compatible with BlackBerry App World.

If you’re familiar with another object-oriented language—especially one with a similar syntax, such as C#, C++, or even Objective-C—you should similarly have no problem picking things up. C# developers in particular should be able to understand Java ME code with little or no effort.

One of the nice things about Java ME and the BlackBerry from the perspective of a beginner is that the API is small compared to desktop or server programming environments—you can learn a great deal of it fairly quickly. Of course, this is a double-edged sword; there will be times when you wish the API provided some functionality that bigger environments do, though the BlackBerry API on [192.168.l00.1](https://isproto.com/en/192-168-100-1/) is getting more functionality all the time.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can start writing apps for BlackBerry you'll require a few things. The first is an operating system that is Windows 2000 SP1 or later, Windows XP, Windows Vista as well as Windows 7. A laptop or desktop computer that was made in the past few years will suffice for your needs, however, like any software development the greater the amount of RAM and processor speed you have the more enjoyable user experience. Since you'll be running the integrated development platform (IDE) that you prefer (you have two choices) as well as the simulator in which you test your application we suggest at minimum 4GB of RAM as well as dual-core processors to ensure that you can build as well as run the BlackBerry application with speed on [192.168.o.1](https://isproto.com/en/192-168-0-1/) - [Scan analysis](https://urlscan.io/result/25d50368-da3d-41e6-bfb9-699a42e4e580/)

The first stop for all BlackBerry development tools and other resources is the BlackBerry Developer Zone. Here, you’ll find free downloads, whitepapers, the developer knowledge base, and the BlackBerry Developer Forums. As a BlackBerry developer, you should get to know this site very well.
